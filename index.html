    <p class="h1"> <i>Lex Orandi</i></p>
<p h2>A Journal of the Liturgical Movement</p>

    <p class="body"> <b>Mission.</b> <i>Lex Orandi</i> is a multilingual, open-access, double-blind peer reviewed academic journal committed to furthering liturgical renewal in a complex and evolving world. Pan-ecclesial, pan-methodological, and public-facing, <i>Lex Orandi</i> makes excellent liturgical scholarship accessible to all in order to contribute to the good of worshipping communities worldwide and to help advance the cause of  church unity.</p>
    <p class="body"> <b>Who We Are.</b> <i>Lex Orandi</i> was founded as a conscious attempt to further the precious heritage of its two predecessor journals, <i>Questions Liturgiques</i> and <i>Worship</i>. Inspired by the Belgian and American liturgical movements, <i>Lex Orandi</i> preserves their defining characteristics: a strong focus on methodological experimentation and the commitment to ecumenical openness and intellectual honesty.</p>
<p class="body">Also in continuity with the Liturgical Movement, <i>Lex Orandi</i> rests on the conviction that the promotion and distribution of high-quality liturgical scholarship is a fundamental means toward the pastoral renewal of the liturgy. The goal of <i>Lex Orandi</i> is to expand the Liturgical Movement’s vision to a world that is infinitely more diverse and complex than when that movement began.</p>
<p class="body"><i>Lex Orandi</i> began as a dream that it is possible to promote rigorous liturgical scholarship from across the entire ecclesial spectrum, using a proliferation of academic methodology as an aid to liturgical renewal. It yearned for this scholarship to be made universally accessible and free for all, to promote the liturgical discernment and formation of local communities worldwide.</p>
<p class="body">In continuity with past generations of scholars, <i>Lex Orandi</i> allows the academic study of liturgy to contribute to ongoing renewal and reform of the liturgy. Finally, it applies the study of liturgy to combat polarization and further unity, both within churches and among them.</p>
<p class="body">Current organizing committee: Kimberly Belcher, Joris Geldhof, Sam Goyvaerts, Tom McLean, assisted by Matthew Cortese, S.J. and Alexander Turpin.</p>
