Inspired by the Belgian and American liturgical movements, Lex Orandi preserves their defining characteristics: a strong focus on methodological experimentation and the commitment to ecumenical openness and intellectual honesty.</p>
<p>Also in continuity with the Liturgical Movement, Lex Orandi rests on the conviction that the promotion and distribution of high-quality liturgical scholarship is a fundamental means toward the pastoral renewal of the liturgy. The goal of Lex Orandi is to expand the Liturgical Movement’s vision to a world that is infinitely more diverse and complex than when that movement began.</p>
<p>Lex Orandi began as a dream that it is possible to promote rigorous liturgical scholarship from across the entire ecclesial spectrum, using a proliferation of academic methodology as an aid to liturgical renewal. It yearned for this scholarship to be made universally accessible and free for all, to promote the liturgical discernment and formation of local communities worldwide.</p>
<p>In continuity with past generations of scholars, Lex Orandi allows the academic study of liturgy to contribute to ongoing renewal and reform of the liturgy. Finally, it applies the study of liturgy to combat polarization and further unity, both within churches and among them.</p>
<p>Current organizing committee: Kimberly Belcher, Joris Geldhof, Sam Goyvaerts, Tom McLean, assisted by Matthew Cortese, S.J., and Alexander Turpin.</p>

An editorial board of six to ten people will serve as the executive board of the non-profit; it will also do the day-to-day work of journal publication. One member of the editorial board will be elected by the other members of the board to serve as editor-in-chief for a one- or two-year term. The editors will be supported by a managing editor, who reports to the editor-in-chief. Funds for operating expenses will be raised through donations from institutional partners and through grant applications. As it makes broader decisions about the direction of the journal, the editorial board will be advised by a larger advisory council, composed of members who represent the institutional partners as well as other scholars in the field.

These journals – Worship and Questions Liturgiques – were founded in the nascent years of the Liturgical Movement and quickly became polestars for the spread of liturgical renewal.
Intimately linked to the beginnings of the Liturgical Movement in Europe, Questions Liturgiques was founded in 1910 by the liturgical pioneer Lambert Beauduin, O.S.B. For over a century, the review was affiliated with his monastery, Mont-César Abbey – now called Keizersberg – in Leuven, Belgium.
Not long after the founding of Questions, the liturgical renewal was brought to the United States by another Benedictine monk, Virgil Michel, O.S.B. To further liturgical renewal for English-language audiences, especially in the North American churches, he established the journal Orate Fratres in 1926, later known as Worship. For the duration of its existence, Worship was published by the monks of St. John’s Abbey in Collegeville, Minnesota.
The Liturgical Movement aimed to capacitate lay people to participate in the liturgy, both through pastoral formation and by scholarly research into liturgical history. These efforts eventually led to the “official” recognition that the best way to renew participation in the liturgy was to reform it, that is, revise its rites, prayers, and structures. The Second Vatican Council’s Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy (1963) enshrined the core principle of the Liturgical Movement as the goal of its program of reform: “full, conscious, and active participation” of the baptized people in the liturgy (Sacrosanctum Concilium #14).
The Liturgical Movement thus found its logical consequence in the liturgical reforms initiated after the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) in the Roman Catholic church. Unexpectedly – at least to many at the time – mainline Protestant scholars and pastors contributed to and benefitted from these journals, and the ideas promoted in them were received by Eastern Orthodox thinkers and congregations, as well.
Much of the credit for the international explosion of the ideals of the Liturgical Movement can be ascribed to those who edited, authored, and disseminated these two journals. As offshoots of the American and Belgian liturgical movements, both journals were characterized by their openness to methodological experimentation. Both were driven by an ecumenical vision that grew in potency over the decades from their very inception, unlike the practitioners of the Liturgical Movement in other parts of the world. And their existence forever associated the field with the pastoral and academic work of (Roman Catholic) monks of the Benedictine Confederation.
Lex Orandi is inspired by the work of these two journals. It honors the contributions of generations of scholars and monastics affiliated with Keisersburg and Saint John’s Abbey, but is not affiliated with either community.

In recent decades, Liturgical Studies has experienced a disconnect from the monastic context in which it arose. Across the globe today, the energy for liturgical study and renewal resides largely in university settings and institutes for pastoral formation. Additionally, methods used in the field of Liturgical Studies have multiplied, so that the term “Liturgical Studies” no longer designates one way of studying the liturgy. Instead, it might be said to encompass a multifaceted, multidisciplinary, and loosely-affiliated group of scholars working across the globe. Lex Orandi provides a forum for all these scholars to benefit from one another’s work.
Further, the social and ecclesial conditions for the study of liturgy have changed. Even as the academic field has expanded across disciplines, the ecclesial situation has also changed and with it the character of processes of liturgical renewal and reinvigoration in church institutions. The growth of the internet as a source for information on “good liturgy” also impacts upon worshipping communities, sometimes for good and sometimes for ill, and the uneven access to this knowledge in communities and across the world shapes its reception.Finally, the same impetus for liturgical renewal that captured the Catholic church in the mid-twentieth century is now being witnessed in new places. The field is even more ecumenical than it was decades ago. Scholars and pastors in Evangelical and Pentecostal churches are eager to reap the fruits of the Liturgical Movement, and even the reform program of Vatican II, but in theologically-disparate contexts. Transcending denominational boundaries, Christians in the Global South also seek resources to assist efforts at liturgical renewal. Finally, scholars across disciplines, who may have limited access to resources because of institutional independence or geographic setting, also look for greater access to high-quality scholarship to inform their study of matters liturgical.
